//! Core domain types and errors for engram.
//!
//! This crate is the closure of the project's vocabulary: identifiers, agent
//! kinds, the workspace-wide error type, and the privacy strip (which is
//! pure-compute, no IO). Nothing in here performs I/O, which keeps it
//! trivially unit-testable and free of platform concerns.
